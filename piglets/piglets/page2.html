        <h2> HTML Attributes </h2>
        <h3> Often an element needs more information to do its job. That's where attributes come in. Each element has a handful of attributes for it. </h3>
        <pre> &lt;img src="piglets.jpeg" alt="Piglets"&gt; <br>
<img src="piglets.jpeg" /> </pre>
        <h3> Attributes are made up of a name and a value. For example, in the example above, src is the source of the image and alt is the alternative text that is shown when you hover your mouse over the image or if the image isn't shown. 
        <br>
        <br>
And that's the basics of HTML elements. Now you just need to which elements are available. Check out this HTML Cheat Sheet for a list of the most common HTML elements and their attributes.</h3>
